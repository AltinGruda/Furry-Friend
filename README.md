# Furry Friend
This website is dedicated to connecting loving individuals with their perfect four-legged companions through pet adoption.

## How It's Made:

**Tech used:** React, Redux, Tailwind

This website was built using React, Redux, Tailwind, and the Petfinder API. It offers a dynamic and visually appealing adoption platform, with React providing a flexible user interface, Redux managing the application state, Tailwind for responsive design, and the Petfinder API for fetching and displaying pet data.

## Optimizations
Although I made some optimizations on API requests, caching, and performance given more time, there are several optimizations I could implement to enhance the user experience like pagination or infinite scrolling.
